# ABN-Team: International

There has been 6 years since ABN-Team came into being, during which we accomplished the transformation from a group purely based on a Minecraft survival server, to a technical team well developing, and from a tiny group made up of couples of fellows, to an well organized team featuring its diversity. From the stage of middle school to that of college, our team is absorbing more and more members, as the economic conditions are also improving. Undoubtedly, The future of ABN-Team promises to be better.

Group activities are not the whole of our life, while they do serve as an essential part. A great number of members of ABN-Team major in computer science or related disciplines, which backs us up on technical development. Apart from that, members majoring in medical science have brought us inspiration and energy.

Enrich topics are well discussed in our team every day, to give some examples, including Minecraft, technical issues, learning experiences, and ACG. To summarize, we are a tightly related whole, men who adopt a GEEK attitude towards life consistently.
